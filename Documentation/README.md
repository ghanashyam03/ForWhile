# Day 1 Progress

## Name : ForWhile

### Goals

- Define the purpose and core concepts of SimpleLang.
- Experiment with syntax options for simplicity and readability.
- Establish foundational syntax rules.

### Purpose

SimpleLang is designed to teach kids basic programming concepts with an easy-to-understand syntax. Key features include:
- Variables
- Arithmetic Operations
- Classes
- Character Creation
- Loops
- Conditionals
- Input/Output
- Comments

### Syntax Exploration

#### Variable Assignment

```
set <variable> name to "Bob"
set <variable> age to 10
```

#### Arithmetic Operations
```
set <variable> age + 5
```

#### Class Definition
```
class Head
  set shape to 'circle'
  set color to 'red'
end class

```
#### Creating and Attaching Characters
```
create character Alice
attach Head to Alice

```
#### Loops
```
repeat 5 times
  set Bob age + 1
end repeat
```

#### Conditionals
```
if Bob age > 5
  set Bob color 'red'
else
  set Bob color 'green'
end if

```
#### Input/Output
```
ask "What is your favorite color?" 
set Bob favorite color (input)
say "Bob's favorite color is " + Bob favorite color

```
#### Comments
```
# Hashtags for comments
```

### Summary


- Goals were set and core concepts defined.
- Syntax options were explored and refined.
- Foundational syntax rules were outlined.
